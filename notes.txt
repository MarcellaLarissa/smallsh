STEP 1:
built in cmds::
x handle blank line
x handle comment line

x cd
x home dir
status 
exit

create child with fork
look at return val of fork -- pid
if pid is 0 you are in child
if its -1 you failed
all else is parent


STEP 2:
write a  new function : run command (takes a cmd pointer)
check to see if it's a built in command (no child process
if so, call correct internal function (exit, status, etc)
otherwise run a child process
    20-25
    take the cmd struct
    fork branches to child and parent
    child will run the program that is in the structure
    look at exec command (exec child)
        if there is redirection, handle here (execvp) 
        pass program name and args


redir input
redir outout
run background
